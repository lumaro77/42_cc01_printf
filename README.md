## What is ft_printf?
Regardless of the programming language considered, the ``printf`` function, (or its equivalents) is always highly useful. The main reason is the ease of its formatting, and the support of diverse types in variable numbers. In short, undeniably, printf is a vital function. In this project, we are ask to recode it and add it to our libft so that we can use it in all of our future projects.

The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for us. It allow us to discover a feature of the C language – variadic functions – and to practice detailed management of the printing options.

## Features
The prototype of ft_printf should be:
```C 
int	ft_printf(const char *, ...); 
```
External functions allowed:
`` malloc, free, write, va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end ``

It will manage the following conversions: ``c s p d i u x X %``

Conversions:
```
%                   (% character)
c    char           (character)
s    char *         (string)
p    void *         (pointer's address)
u    unsigned int   (unsigned decimal integer)
x/X: unsigned int   (hexadecimal)
d/i: int            (integer)
```
